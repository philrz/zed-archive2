# Zed is now SuperDB

Ongoing development of the code base for the project formerly known as Zed has
moved to the [SuperDB project](https://github.com/brimdata/super).

This archive repository captures a point-in-time record of Zed as of its
[final GA release v1.18.0](https://github.com/philrz/zed-archive2/releases/tag/v1.18.0) ([documentation](https://zed.brimdata.io/docs)).
The [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) captures the history of Zed up to that release.
The headers in the CHANGELOG are hyperlinks to the commit hashes in the
[super repo](https://github.com/brimdata/super) that correspond to when each
Zed release was originally tagged.

While we strongly encourage users to adopt SuperDB, if you have questions
about old Zed releases feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/brimdata/super/issues/new/choose)
or reach out to us on [public Slack](https://www.brimdata.io/join-slack/).
